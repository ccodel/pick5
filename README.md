# The Pick 5 website
## Feeling lucky?

### About
The Pick 5 Football Club is all about selecting five games for or against the spread in the NFL during the regular season. Those that choose correctly earn "P&L units."

### Foundations
The Pick 5 website is built on standard HTML, CSS, JS, and SQLite3 code and commands.

### Site logistics
The site is administered by so-called "Administrators," or admin, that enter the sessions and the results for each session during the regular season.
